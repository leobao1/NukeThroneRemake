Procedural Generation Tutorial
Unity Project Files
Read Me

There are two seperate scenes in this project, and two seperate generation scripts.

The scene "Tutorial" and script "LevelGenerator" are what was went over in the tutorial.
This is what you would use as a reference if you wanted implement this system in a project.

The scene "(Demo) Slow Gen" and script "SlowGenerator" are scrictly for demostrastion purposes.
The script used here purposefully waits, slowly down its process, so that you can see it being done.
I only made this so that I could record it as footage for the tutorial, but since its such a good
demonstration of the process of the algorithm, I'm leaving it in the Unity package as well.

Hope this doesn't cause any confusion!
